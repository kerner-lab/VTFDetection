The trachydacitic domes and associated lava flows were erupted along regional ENE–WSW-trending faults. The largest of the domes is Monte Amiata (La Vetta), a compound lava dome with a trachytic lava flow that extends to the east. A massive viscous trachydacitic lava flow, 5-km long and 4-km wide, is part of the basal complex and extends from beneath the southern base of the Corno de Bellaria dome. Radiometric dates indicate a major eruptive episode about 300,000 years ago. No eruptive activity has occurred during the Holocene, but thermal activity, including cinnabar mineralization, continues at a producing geothermal field near the town of Bagnore, at the SW end of the dome complex."

The Kamari caldera is of mid-Pleistocene age and contains the 1.0–0.55 million-year-old, post-caldera Zini lava dome. The formation of a large caldera deposited the widespread Kos Plateau Tuff (erupted about 160,000 years ago), which blankets much of the western half of Kos and originated from a stratovolcano between Kos and Nisyros islands. The caldera dimensions are uncertain, but may extend as much as 20 km from Kefalos Bay in SW Kos Island to Nisyros Island. Remnants of the preeruption stratovolcano are preserved on the islets of Pachia and Pyrgousa and as submarine volcanic rocks on Nisyros. Kos was included in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Georgalas, 1962) based on its geothermal activity. Several solfatara fields are present, including Vromotopos at Kefalos Isthmus on the western side of the island and a group of thermal areas at the eastern side of Kos. Thermal activity consists of weak hydrogen sulfide emission, sulfur deposits, and two hot springs along the southeastern coast."

222150,Kilimanjaro,Tanzania,Quiescent Ground-based,B2,,,Ground-based 2013,,,,,,,,,,,,"Massive Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, consists of three large stratovolcanoes constructed along a NW–SE trend. The ice-capped summit towers 5,200 m above the surrounding plains. Activity at the older Shira cone, which forms the broad WNW shoulder, began during the Pliocene. The extensively dissected Pleistocene Mawenzi forms a prominent, sharp-topped peak on the upper ESE flank, dominated by a densely packed radial dike swarm. More than 250 satellitic cones occupy a rift zone to the NW and SE of Kibo, the central stratovolcano. A 2.4 x 3.6 km caldera gives the summit of Kibo an elongated, broad profile. Most of Kilimanjaro was constructed during the Pleistocene, but fumarolic activity is present within a group of youthful-looking nested summit craters. Widespread statements that the ""most recent activity was about 200 years ago,"" sometimes referencing the central ""ash pit"" formation, are of unknown origin with no supporting evidence in geological or anthropological literature. Nonnotte and others (2008) K-Ar dated caldera rim group lavas in the 170–274 ka range, and placed the most recent volcanism (formation of both the present summit crater, Inner Crater group lavas, and parasitic flank cones) around 150–200 ka."

The island is 15 x 5 km wide and elongated E–W. The 354-m-high central dome complex is flanked by East Dome, which forms the eastern tip of the island and is the oldest of the domes, and Pa Hill lava dome, which forms the NW tip of the island. Acid hot springs, steaming ground, and fumaroles are located primarily between the central cone and East Dome. The central cone and east dome are both older than the roughly 42,000 years B.P. Rotoehu Tephra, and Pa Hill dome is overlain by the 9,000 years B.P. Rotoma Ash but may be considerably older. It was included in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Nairn and Cole, 1975) based on its thermal activity."

It is the only single-event caldera in the Taupo Volcanic Zone and was formed about 220,000-years ago following eruption of the more than 340 km3 rhyolitic Mamaku Ignimbrite. Although caldera collapse occurred in a single event, the process was complex and involved multiple collapse blocks. The major city of Rotorua lies at the south end of the lake that fills much of the caldera. Post-collapse eruptive activity, which ceased during the Pleistocene, was restricted to lava dome extrusion without major explosive activity. The youngest activity consisted of the eruption of three lava domes less than 25,000 years ago. The major thermal areas of Takeke, Tikitere, Lake Rotokawa, and Rotorua-Whakarewarewa are located within the caldera or outside its rim, and the city of Rotorua lies within and adjacent to active geothermal fields."

Two large steep-sided, flat-topped lava domes occupy the NNE flank, and two smaller domes are located to the west. The last significant eruption occurred about 18,000 years ago, and no direct evidence for Holocene eruptions has been observed. Weak solfataric activity is present and there was an unverified report from local inhabitants of an eruption during the early 1940's. Weak fumarolic activity continues in the summit crater."

There was a report of an eruption or ""displacement"" in the region on 4 January 1641, described as an outburst of water accompanied by an earthquake. That is also the date of the major eruption of Parker volcano in southern Mindanao that impacted much of the Philippines. The Asin Hot Springs are about 12 km NNW of the summit, but their connection to the volcano is unknown."

Mid-Pleistocene eruptions beginning about 580,000 years ago formed lava domes on the northern side of the complex. The present edifice was formed beginning about 270,000 years ago, and flank lava dome emplacement took place from about 200,000 to about 40,000 years ago. The latest activity from Mt. Labo produced pyroclastic flows from the summit cone about 27,000 years ago.

A central cone fills a 4–4.5 km caldera, whose rim is visible on the northeast side. A second caldera on the west side is breached to the west. An Ainu village that reportedly was destroyed by an eruption in 1872 was later found to be located near Sinarka volcano (Gorshkov, 1970). The only known postglacial activity of Kuntomintar is continuous solfataric activity that originates near the east wall of the inner caldera and a nearby hot sulfur spring."

Adagdak consists of a small stratovolcano capping an older shield volcano exposed on the southern side of the complex. An andesitic lava dome fills the summit crater. A late-stage basaltic lava dome was constructed on the SE flank, and a phreatic vent is located on the western flank of the shield volcano. The most recent eruptions have been considered to be Holocene (Marsh, in Wood and Kienle 1990) or Pleistocene (Motyka and others, 1994, Nye and others, 1998). Three stages of volcanism were mapped by Bratten, the youngest of which was a lava dome dated at about 0.21 million years (AVO, 2005). The older Andrew Bay volcano, located north of Andrew Lagoon between Adagdak and Moffett volcanoes, is preserved only in erosional remnants. Andrew Bay Hot Springs lie along the coast west of Mount Adagdak, and the northern part of Adak Island has been investigated for geothermal power potential."

Much of the field lies within the China Lake Naval Weapons Center. Active fumaroles and thermal springs are present in an area that is a producing geothermal field. The youngest eruptions were chemically bimodal, forming basaltic lava flows along with 38 rhyolitic lava flows and domes, most with youthful, constructional forms. The latest dated eruption formed the Volcano Peak basaltic cinder cone and lava flow and was Potassium-Argon dated at 39,000 +/- 33,000 years ago. Although most activity ended during the late Pleistocene, the youngest lava dome may be of Holocene age based on geomorphological evidence (Monastero 1998, pers. comm.)."

Resurgent doming in the central part of the caldera occurred shortly afterwards, followed by rhyolitic eruptions from the caldera moat and the eruption of rhyodacite from outer ring fracture vents, ending about 50,000 years ago. During early resurgent doming the caldera was filled with a large lake that left strandlines on the caldera walls and the resurgent dome island; the lake eventually drained through the Owens River Gorge. The caldera remains thermally active, with many hot springs and fumaroles, and has had significant deformation, seismicity, and other unrest in recent years. The late-Pleistocene to Holocene Inyo Craters cut the NW topographic rim of the caldera, and along with Mammoth Mountain on the SW topographic rim, are west of the structural caldera and are chemically and tectonically distinct from the Long Valley magmatic system."

The upper member, the Tshirege, is dated about 1.2 Ma, and also deposited voluminous welded pyroclastic flows over about the same area as the Otawi. Post-caldera volcanism has included the emplacement of multiple ring-fracture lava domes and uplift of the caldera floor, forming the Redondo Peak resurgent dome. The El Cajete Pumice, Battleship Rock Ignimbrite, Banco Bonito Rhyolite, and the VC-1 Rhyolite were emplaced during the latest eruption, about 50,000-60,000 years ago.

La Primavera caldera subsequently filled with water, forming a lake, through which several lava domes were emplaced. The eruption of a series of domes along the margin of the caldera about 95,000 years ago was followed about 75,000 years ago by the eruption of a younger series of ring domes. Uplift and sedimentation filled the lake, and a final series of lava domes was erupted along the southern margin of the caldera beginning about 60,000 years B.P., with the youngest dome dated at about 30,000 years B.P. Steam vents and hot springs currently are active throughout the volcanic complex."

Located about 200 km NW of Mexico City, the Los Azufres center consists of a 18 x 20 km wide early Pleistocene caldera that was later partially filled by resurgent dacitic-to-rhyolitic lava domes. Two magmatic cycles lasting about 200,000 years each took place between 1.4 and 0.8 Ma, consisting of silicic, followed by basaltic volcanism. The latest magmatic cycle, beginning about 0.6 Ma, involved resurgent doming of the southern part of the caldera, the eruption of chemically diverse basaltic-to-rhyolitic products, and the emplacement of dacitic-rhyolitic lava domes. The latest paroxysmal eruptions produced ignimbrites between 38,000 and 26,000 years ago. Hot springs and fumaroles are located along E-W-trending faults, and Los Azufres is an active producing geothermal field."

The youngest major feature of La Yeguada is located within a large fault-bounded horst that forms the high point of the volcanic complex east of Laguna La Yeguada. The latest eruptions took place from the northern part of the horst about 220,000 years ago at Cerro Corero lava dome (also known as Cerro de la Charca), north of El Castillo. The youngest feature of the La Yeguada complex is the Media Luna cinder cone, which was erupted through Tertiary ignimbrite deposits at the NW side of the complex. The oldest peat layer within a small lake dammed by a basaltic lava flow originating from the cone was radiocarbon dated at about 300–350 years ago, but later dating has shown that flow was erupted about 45,000 years ago, and that the La Yeguada complex has not had Holocene eruptions. Warm springs are scattered throughout the complex, and the Chitra-Calobre geothermal field is one of three areas in PanamÃ¡ that have been the object of intensive geothermal exploration."

Extensive Pleistocene glacial moraines surround the stratovolcano, but postglacial lava flows overlie these moraines on the upper southern flanks (de Silva and Francis, 1991). Wörner and others (2000) obtained surprisingly old Potassium-Argon dates of 400,000 to 780,000 years from the youngest flows on the NE and SW flanks, and eruptive activity appears to have ended during the late Pleistocene.

Inspection of satellite images of the 6,008-m-high peak, located SE of Quetana, did not show evidence for postglacial activity (de Silva and Francis, 1991). Andesitic and dacitic lava flows dominate on Uturuncu, and no pyroclastic deposits were observed during recent field work. Although young lava flows display well-preserved flow features, youthful-looking summit lava flows showed evidence of glaciation. Two active sulfur-producing fumarole fields are located near the summit, and large-scale ground deformation was observed beginning in May 1992 (Pritchard and Simons, 2002), indicating, along with seismicity detected in 2009–10 (Jay and others, 2012), that a magmatic system is still present."
